OMG okay, so I just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Peter Pan's Neverland Nightmare and like, WOW. No joke, that was a wild ride. I mean, who even thought to make a horror version of Peter Pan? 🤯 Tbh, I didn't even know what I was getting into when I decided to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , but whoa, it was intense.

Like, dude, can we talk about how dark Neverland is now? It’s literally haunting. No more happy-go-lucky vibes with the Lost Boys and Tink or whatever. Those lost boys?? More like lost souls now, y’know what I mean? It's like if Peter had a bad day and just snapped. Seriously, all I wanted was some cool nostalgia, and I got jump scares instead, go figure! 

Remember how we used to think Neverland was all fun and adventures? Well, think again, my friend. Even Captain Hook's got nothing on these new creepers lurking around. Like, there’s literally a scene where I was just shouting at the screen like, PETER, NOOO!

> Also, Tinker Bell’s a straight-up menace! I feel like if you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , you're never gonna look at her the same way again. It's so twisted but kinda brilliant? I'm still processing if I love or hate it, but honestly, mad respect for whoever had the guts to flip the script like this. I mean, props for creativity, or maybe I've just lost my mind, lol.

And Smee, OH MAN, don’t even get me started on Smee. Dude went from comic relief to something outta a fever dream. Like what even? It’s like the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮makers just said screw it! Let’s shock everyone. Anyway, it was like if Tim Burton took over a Disney classic, but maybe had a few too many Red Bulls, haha.

Anyway, this is defs one of those flicks you just need to see to believe. I can't say I'd recommend it to anyone with fond childhood memories, but sometimes you gotta shake things up a bit, right? I guess nothing is sacred anymore. 😂 Let me know if you decide to brace it yourself. It's a trip.
